                Founded in February 1979 by Professor Antonio José Restrepo with
                the goal of establishing the first University Scuba Diving Club
                in Colombia, carrying out activities at the University of
                Antioquia. Initially, it was named the University of Antioquia
                Orcas Underwater Activities Club.

                In 1989, Luis Fernando Botero was elected as the president of
                the club, who ventured into the sports of Underwater Rugby and
                Underwater Hockey. In 1988, Orcas Club organized the first
                National Championship of Underwater Rugby and Underwater Hockey
                in Antioquia.

                Since its beginnings, Underwater Rugby demonstrated itself as a
                strength and gradually gained recognition on the national level,
                consistently competing for top positions. The first
                international participation by club members occurred at the 1991
                World Championships in Finland, with three players selected to
                join the Colombian National Team

                This is how the Orcas Club increasingly contributed more players
                to the Colombian national teams that would compete in the World
                Championships. The club continued to improve its level, and by
                the 2003 World Championship, it had the core of the Colombian
                national team.

                The club continued to win national championships, and in 2010,

                first time to participate in the Champions Cup, an international
                tournament where the champion clubs from each country that
                practices Underwater Rugby compete. In this tournament, the
                women's team secured the first place, and the men's team
                finished in second place. This achievement led to the women's
